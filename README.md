# Classification-of-Brain-Tumor-MRI-Scans
This project investigates the performance of various classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors, for the classification of Brain Tumor MRI scans. The proposed approach utilizes these algorithms for feature extraction and classification to develop an automated system for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. The system has the potential to assist radiologists in making accurate diagnosis and ultimately improve patient care by reducing the time required for diagnosis. The proposed approach can also be extended to other medical imaging modalities and diseases, providing a valuable tool for disease diagnosis and detection using machine learning based classification.
